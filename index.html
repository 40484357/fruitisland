                    Hey Welcome to Fruit Island. Not sure if you remember, but Society imploded and a few of us got it. We occasionally go back to the main land
                    to see if there are any survivors and someone picked you up. <br><br>

                    Capitalism burned the world, so we're a socialist state... kind of. Everything is shared except fruit. Fruit is a luxury,
                    our main source of sugar but it's fairly scarce.<br><br>
                
                     See fruits allow us to do many things, add variety to our foods, make alcohol, make sweet drinks etc. You can sell fruits or fruit
                    based products for seeds, not fruit seeds but sunflower seeds and you can use those sunflower seeds to buy fruit seeds from people 
                    and grow more fruits. I'll start you off, here's some lemon seeds. </p><br>
